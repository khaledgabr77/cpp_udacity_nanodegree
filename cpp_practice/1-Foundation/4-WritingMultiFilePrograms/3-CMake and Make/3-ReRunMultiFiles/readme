Compiling One File of Many, Step 2
But what if you make changes to your code and you need to re-compile? In that case, you can compile only the file that you changed, and you can use the existing object files from the unchanged source files for linking.

Try changing the code in /multiple_files_example/main.cpp to have different numbers in the vector and save the file with CTRL-s.

When you have done that, re-compile just main.cpp by running:


root@abc123defg:/home/workspace/multiple_files_example# g++ -c main.cpp
root@abc123defg:/home/workspace/multiple_files_example# g++ *.o
root@abc123defg:/home/workspace/multiple_files_example# ./a.out
Compiling just the file you have changed saves time if there are many files and compilation takes a long time. However, the process above is tedious when using many files, especially if you don't remember which ones you have modified.

For larger projects, it is helpful to use a build system which can compile exactly the right files for you and take care of linking.
