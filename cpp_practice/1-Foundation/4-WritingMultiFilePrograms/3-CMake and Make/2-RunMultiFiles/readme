Compiling One File of Many, Step 1Â¶
In the previous example, you compiled a single source code file to an object file, and that object file was then converted into an executable.

Now you are going to try the same process with multiple files. Navigate to the multiple_files_example directory in the terminal to the right. This directory should have the increment_and_sum and vect_add_one files from a previous Notebook. Try compiling with the commands below:


root@abc123defg:/home/workspace/multiple_files_example# g++ -c *.cpp
root@abc123defg:/home/workspace/multiple_files_example# g++ *.o
root@abc123defg:/home/workspace/multiple_files_example# ./a.out
Here, the * operator is a wildcard, so any matching file is selected. If you compile and run these files together, the executable should print:

The total is: 14
