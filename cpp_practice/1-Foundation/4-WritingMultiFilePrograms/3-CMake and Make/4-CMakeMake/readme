CMake and Make
CMake is an open-source, platform-independent build system. CMake uses text documents, denoted as CMakeLists.txt files, to manage build environments, like make. A comprehensive tutorial on CMake would require an entire course, but you can learn the basics of CMake here, so you'll be ready to use it in the upcoming projects.

CMakeLists.txt
CMakeList.txt files are simple text configuration files that tell CMake how to build your project. There can be multiple CMakeLists.txt files in a project. In fact, one CMakeList.txt file can be included in each directory of the project, indicating how the files in that directory should be built.

These files can be used to specify the locations of necessary packages, set build flags and environment variables, specify build target names and locations, and other actions.

In the next few pages of this workspace, you are going to create a basic CMakeLists.txt file to build a small project.

If you have trouble with any of these steps, see the file SolutionCMakeLists.txt in the tab on the right.
